# BusinessCalendar
I need to develop an application that performs the functions of a business calendar.
1. Define entities and add them to the application as models
2. Generate database with defined entities
3. REST architecture development
4. Front-end application development
5. Learning and implementing web sockets to allow the server respond to the client without the client's request
6. Api development to facilitate access to the server-side Task Scheduler
