# BusinessCalendar
I need to develop an application that performs the functions of a business calendar.\n
1. Define entities and add them to the application as models\n
2. Generate database with defined entities\n
3. REST architecture development\n
4. Front-end application development\n
5. Learning and implementing web sockets to allow the server respond to the client without the client's request\n
6. Api development to facilitate access to the server-side Task Scheduler\n
